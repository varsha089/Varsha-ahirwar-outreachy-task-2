===<big>Introduction:</big> ===

* I have listed articles about '''Plasma Physics:''' one of the four fundamental states of matter.
* I chose 12 different sets of articles published by different authors at different times and locations.
* Author names are listed in articles which I chose, either {{P|2093}} formate or {{P|50}}.
* Authors who are grouped under {{P|50}} have separate wikidata about individual's information, and {{P|50}} would redirect to that wikidata, on the other side authors grouped under {{P|2093}} have no separate wikidata about themselves.
* Authors have the qualifier {{P|1545}}, which is the same as the order in the original articles.

=== <big>Bonus:</big> ===
===== <small>What are properties and how they work:</small> =====
* During completing task 1 as I understood properties are as features or categories which a object or instance has for example - If author is object than it is categorized in {{P|31}} ,{{P|21}} etc.
* There should be atleast one value correspond to a property.
* Properties are stored as P 'template' on wikidata.
===== <small>What are value and how they work:</small> =====
*  ON wikidata , value is called as items which correspond to a specific property . Ex- For property {{P|21}} correspond value is {{Q|6581097}}.
*  Value are stored as  Q 'template' correspond to P' template'.
*  To add a new item in property that item must already be present on Wikidata.
==== <small>What are qualifier and how they work:</small> ====
*  Qualifiers are the further discription of values. Ex- In property {{P|108}},{{Q|2738622}} is a value correspond to {{P|108}} and {{P|580}} is a qualifier correspond to value {{Q|2738622}}.
*  Qualifier are stored in P - Q pair of template .
*  There should be atleast 1 Q 'template' for P 'template' in qualifier.

===== <small>What are properties and how they work:</small> =====
* During completing task 1 as I understood properties are as features or categories which a object or instance has for example - If author is object than it is categorized in {{P|31}} ,{{P|21}} etc.
* There should be atleast one value correspond to a property.
* Properties are stored as P 'template' on wikidata.
===== <small>What are value and how they work:</small> =====
*  ON wikidata , value is called as items which correspond to a specific property . Ex- For property {{P|21}} correspond value is {{Q|6581097}}.
*  Value are stored as  Q 'template' correspond to P' template'.
*  To add a new item in property that item must already be present on Wikidata.
==== <small>What are qualifier and how they work:</small> ====
*  Qualifiers are the further discription of values. Ex- In property {{P|108}},{{Q|2738622}} is a value correspond to {{P|108}} and {{P|580}} is a qualifier correspond to value {{Q|2738622}}.
*  Qualifier are stored in P - Q pair of template .
*  There should be atleast 1 Q 'template' for P 'template' in qualifier.
